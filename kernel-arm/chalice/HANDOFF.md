# CHALICE HANDOFF — Windows-ABI compatibility layer for GAIA-OS

Purpose: let GAIA-OS run programs built for the Windows ABI, the same way
**ReactOS, Wine, and Proton** do — by implementing the published NT service
interface as a GAIA-OS "personality." Ordinary OS-compatibility engineering:
our kernel becomes the floor a portable PE userland stands on. No target
software is modified; we implement a documented ABI so existing binaries load
and run. Donors cloned as read-only quarry (gitignored): `wine/`, `reactos/`,
`proton/`.

## STATE — SLICE 3 COMPLETE (2026-07-18), verified live. HEAD ~`2c1adf9`.

**A real Win32-API-calling PE runs natively on the Temple.** `pe7` runs
`hello6.exe` — a genuine ARM64 PE with a real `KERNEL32.dll` import table
(`GetStdHandle`/`WriteFile`/`ExitProcess`) — over the three stock **Hangover
11.9 ARM64** core libraries (`ntdll.dll`, `kernel32.dll`, `kernelbase.dll`,
unmodified, in `chalice/stock/`). Full chain fires:

`hello6.exe → kernel32!WriteFile → kernelbase → ntdll → our NtWriteFile → serial`

Verified serial output: **`CHALICE: kernel32 speaks`** then **`pe7 ret=77`**,
clean exit, shell survives (`T:/>` returns). No macOS / Wine call-translation
layer underneath — the kernel answers the NT service ABI itself.

Shell verbs (all green in the gate):
- `pe1`/`pe2`/`pe` — slice-1 PE loader (our own test exes over `libgaia` shims)
- `pe3` — NtContinue leap + KUSER floor
- `pe4` — DLL load-by-name + export link (`mini.dll`)
- `pe5` — boot-protocol dress rehearsal over `fake-ntdll.dll`
- `pe6` — stock ntdll runs an import-less exe to completion (`ret=99`)
- `pe7` — **stock ntdll+kernel32+kernelbase run a real WriteFile-calling exe**
  (`kernel32 speaks`, `ret=77`)

## Build & test — the only loop that counts

```
cd kernel-arm/zoneA && GAIA_NO_RUN=1 bash build.sh    # build ONLY
```
- **NEVER launch QEMU naked** — `build.sh`'s tail `exec`s QEMU on stdio. Build
  with `GAIA_NO_RUN=1`; run shell verbs ONLY through the unix-socket harnesses
  `scratch/chalice_gate.py` (pe1–pe6 + required-green lines) and
  `scratch/pe7_gate.py` (pe7). `pgrep qemu` + kill leaks before every boot.
- **Checkpoint-commit before every boot/test loop** — the 30-min worker cap /
  900s stall abort has eaten uncommitted work repeatedly.
- **Required-green gate (no regression):** `pe1 ret=42` · cup fills ·
  `pe2 ret=7` · cup speaks · continue lands · NT10 · `pe3 ret=99` · cup links ·
  `pe4 ret=60` · thunk enters · chain speaks · `pe5 ret=99` · stock ntdll
  mapped · stock thunk enters. Plus `scratch/ramfb_gate.py` (`-m 1G` baked into
  build.sh; 7 pixel checks).
- **Source-only commits** — `chalice/*.exe`/`.dll`/`.pdb` and
  `zoneA/pehello_bin.c` are build artifacts that churn every `build.sh`; leave
  them uncommitted.
- **Tooling:** `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm@20/bin/llvm-objdump` disassembles the
  stock DLLs (ImageBase `0x180000000`, so file-RVA = vaddr − 0x180000000). Real
  Wine ARM64 syscall-number map frozen at `chalice/wine-arm64-syscalls.txt`
  (260 entries). Donor `wine/` is gitignored — a fresh clone lacks it; the main
  working copy has it. Method that worked all of slice 3: **measure, don't
  guess** — instrument-first per fault, resolve every address to
  `<module>+offset`, disassemble the donor to ground the fix.

## What's implemented (the NT service floor)

**Dispatcher (`zoneA/ntdisp.S`).** Wine's ARM64 path never traps: a PE stub
loads a fn-ptr from the TEB and `blr`s it. `nt_dispatch` is a table-dispatched
indirect call in one address space (no user/kernel split). Real Wine
convention: service number in `x8`, caller return address in `x9`; preserves
`x18` (TEB) + `x19–x28` across the boundary (a real syscall clobbers only
`x0`). Service table = 512 slots indexed by the **real Wine ARM64 syscall
numbers**; unregistered → `NtStub` → `STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.

**Memory.** `NtAllocate/FreeVirtualMemory` back from the **0.75GB
identity-mapped territory** (`nt_territory_alloc`, `0x45000000`→`0x7ff00000`,
64KB-aligned per allocation), NOT the 64MB kernel heap. `NtProtectVirtualMemory`
accounted (flat model, no enforcement). `NtQueryVirtualMemory
(MemoryBasicInformation)` returns the true image AllocationBase from the image
registry — struct is **0x30 bytes**. KUSER_SHARED_DATA at `0x7ffe0000`.

**Image loading (`zoneA/pemod.c`, `zoneA/ntfile.c`).**
`NtCreateSection(SEC_IMAGE)` + `NtMapViewOfSection` map a DLL via `PeMapImage`
into territory. `NtQuerySection(SectionImageInformation)` reports the image's
Machine (0xAA64)/entry/stack sizes from the PE header. **`PeMapImage` has an
`apply_relocs` param:** `NtMapViewOfSection` passes `apply_relocs=0` (the
PE-side guest loader relocates SEC_IMAGE maps itself — donor `loader.c`
`build_module`→`perform_relocations`, unconditional); `PeRun` (standalone exes)
and `nt_boot_process`'s own ntdll/exe bootstrap pass `apply_relocs=1`.

**TEB/PEB + boot protocol (`zoneA/ntboot.c`).** `nt_boot_process` maps
ntdll+exe (Phase-0, mirrors Wine's unix side), builds TEB (4 trapdoor pointers)
+ PEB (`ApiSetMap`@0x68 via `apisetschema.dll`; Ldr module list with an ntdll
self-entry), wires the three unixlib pointers (`__wine_syscall_dispatcher`→
`nt_dispatch`, `__wine_unixlib_handle`, `__wine_unix_call_dispatcher`→
`nt_unix_call_shim`), pushes a synthetic CONTEXT, enters `LdrInitializeThunk`.

**Locale/NLS.** `NtInitializeNlsFiles` + `NtGetNlsSectionPtr` map
`locale.nls`/`sortdefault.nls`/`l_intl.nls` into territory;
`NtQueryDefaultLocale` → `0x0409`.

**Registry floor.** Minimal, in-memory: `NtCreateKey`→dummy pseudo-handle,
`NtOpenKey`/`NtQueryValueKey`→`STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND` (guest falls back
to NLS defaults), `NtSetValueKey`→no-op SUCCESS. No hive, no persistence.

**Exceptions / instrumentation (`zoneA/kmain.c`).** `NtRaiseException`/
`NtRaiseHardError` print a legible line (code + resolved `<module>+offset`) and
cleanly terminate the process instead of crash-looping. `sync_handler` dumps a
full register + fp-chain backtrace resolved through the image registry. An IRQ
PC-sampler (`profile_armed`) locates spin loops.

Real services live: NtWriteFile, NtClose, NtTerminateProcess,
NtAllocate/Free/ProtectVirtualMemory, NtQueryVirtualMemory,
NtQueryInformationProcess (ProcessBasicInformation), NtQuerySystemInformation
(SystemBasicInformation), NtContinue, NtCreateSection/MapViewOfSection/
QuerySection, NtOpenFile/ReadFile, NtInitializeNlsFiles/GetNlsSectionPtr, the
registry floor, NtRaiseException/HardError, NtQueryDefaultLocale.

## Scars / laws (each cost a debugging cycle — keep them)

1. **Register preservation:** `nt_dispatch` must preserve `x18` + `x19–x28`
   across the syscall boundary; a real syscall clobbers only `x0`. Leaking a
   kernel pointer or clobbering a callee-saved reg corrupts the guest's locals.
2. **Return convention:** stock Wine stubs pass the caller LR in `x9`
   (`mov x9,x30; blr; ret`) — return to it, not `x30`.
3. **Real syscall numbers:** the service table is indexed by Wine's real ARM64
   numbers (`wine-arm64-syscalls.txt`), not hand-assigned ids.
4. **LLP64:** PE-side pointer-target integers are 64-bit; match widths on
   in/out params.
5. **`build_ntdll_module` learns ntdll's own base** via
   `NtQueryVirtualMemory(MemoryBasicInformation).AllocationBase` on an in-ntdll
   address — that struct is **0x30 bytes**, and a too-strict length check made
   ntdll lose its own base (broke every self-import lookup).
6. **Guest self-relocation:** the PE-side loader relocates SEC_IMAGE maps
   itself → `NtMapViewOfSection` must NOT relocate (else `file + 2×delta`).
7. **Unixlib pointer triplet:** `*_dispatcher`/`*_handle` exports with adjacent
   RVAs are one wiring struct — check neighbors, not just the named export.
8. **Territory 64KB-aligned:** DLL image bases must be 64KB-aligned (Windows
   allocation granularity).
9. **Trapdoor pointers first:** miss one of TEB.NtTib.Self / PEB / PEB.Ldr /
   ProcessParameters and ntdll dies silently before its first service call.

## NEXT — the road to games (Pascal rules the forks)

`pe7` is the userland foundation, proven. Games (Teardown, MXO) need two more
layers — **both are Pascal's design decisions, not autonomous work:**

- **C3 — graphics.** Minimal `win32u` + a GPU/display path (shares a rung with
  the ramfb work). Teardown wants **OpenGL**; MXO wants **DirectX 9** (already
  proven under DXVK, config in-hand). Bring an options page before building.
- **C4 — x86 door.** Games are mostly x86 (MXO 32-bit primary, Teardown
  x86-64). Hangover ships the translator **as a PE DLL above this floor** (never
  a Linux substrate underneath). **Engine choice = Pascal's
  ruling: FEX vs Box64** (both ship in Hangover 11.9). 32-bit path is primary
  (≈99% of games).
- **C5 — bare metal.** QEMU is the debug rig; target is Apple-silicon metal
  (split lands at GPU + bootloader). The "replace macOS" throne.

Law: **NO DRM in the Temple** (doctrine + the only thing needing enforced memory
protection our flat model lacks). Both target games scanned clean.

Donor value: **ReactOS** = NT-kernel reference · **Wine** = userland ABI
reference · **Proton** = games-grade compatibility reference.

## Immediate next step for a fresh session

Read a full fresh `pe7` trace past `kernel32 speaks` — `pe7` currently exits at
the WriteFile milestone (`ret=77`) by design (hello6 prints and exits). To push
further, either (a) extend `hello6.exe` to call more Win32 surface (console
setup, more kernelbase/kernel32 APIs) and burn down whatever it newly needs, or
(b) start C3/C4 per Pascal's ruling. Every gap from here shows itself as a
legible `CHALICE FAULT` / `NtRaiseException` line resolved to `<module>+offset`
— instrument-first, measure, then fix.
