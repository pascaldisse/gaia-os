# Gaia OS: AI-Integrated Operating System for Apple Silicon

Gaia OS is an AI-integrated operating system based on Arch Linux, specifically designed for M1/M2/M3 Macs. It leverages the power of Apple Silicon, including the neural engine, to create a responsive, intelligent computing environment.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a fully functional Linux distribution with deeply integrated AI capabilities, optimized for Apple Silicon hardware. By building on Asahi Linux and Arch Linux, Gaia OS provides cutting-edge hardware support with the flexibility of Arch.

## Features

- **Apple Silicon Optimization**: Fully leverages the M1/M2/M3 architecture, including neural engine access
- **AI Integration**: Deep system-level AI capabilities for enhanced user experience
- **Customizable**: Built on Arch Linux for maximum flexibility and customization
- **Developer-Friendly**: Comprehensive development environment and tools
- **Community-Focused**: Open source with active community engagement

## Getting Started

Please refer to [instructions.md](instructions.md) for detailed, step-by-step guides on:
1. Installing Asahi Linux as the base system
2. Setting up the development environment
3. Installing and configuring AI libraries
4. Integrating AI features into the system
5. Building a custom distribution
6. Testing and deployment
